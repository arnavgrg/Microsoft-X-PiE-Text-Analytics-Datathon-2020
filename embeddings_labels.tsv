At approximately 4:20 A.M., SWAT, one Sergeant and two officers, approached the residence in an armored vehicle known as a Bearcat, to deploy the gas. As they approached, the subject opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, striking the bearcat windshield on the driver’s side and the passenger rear view side mirror. A SWAT officer returned fire with a rifle, striking the subject in the hip. The subject retreated into the residence. OC gas was deployed into the residence, with no effect. Bellevue Police Department (BPD) SWAT and the Arson Bomb Squad (ABS) were requested as additional resources.

At 7:33 P.M. four Seattle Police Officers responded to the incident, which was dispatched as a “weapons” call. While enroute to the call, one of the officers used the license plate reported by the reporting party to identify the vehicle as one involved in an incident on the 7th of October, in which the subjects fled from police. At 7:42 P.M., officers located the vehicle and approached. As the officers approached, the subjects became aware of their presence. Officers identified themselves as Seattle Police and ordered them to “get on the ground.” The subjects attempted to flee by driving forward, toward one of the officers. Two officers opened fire on the vehicle as it continued forward and then made a 90 degree turn northbound. The officers continued to fire as the vehicle drove away from them.

Officers attempted to access the subject inside the vehicle but the doors were locked and the windows were up. The subject ignored repeated commands to surrender and continued to search the inside of the vehicle, apparently attempting to access a firearm. One officer fired five rounds, striking the subject. Officers extracted the subject from the vehicle and attempted to render aid. Seattle Fire Department arrived at 5:23 A.M. and took over care. The subject died at the scene.
20180000486972	POLICE OFFICER	White	Male	3	Handgun	Male	Nat Hawaiian/Oth Pac Islander	36	Yes	Yes	Within Policy	No	On the 31st of December 2018, at approximately 5:00 P.M., two Seattle Police Officers in a two-person unit (a single car occupied by two officers, dispatched as a single resource) initiated a traffic stop in the 9500 block of Aurora Avenue North. The vehicle was marked with emergency lights activated to signal the stop. The stop was conducted based on an observed illegal lane change. Additionally, a check of the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) system, indicated the registered owner of the vehicle had a “suspended / revoked” license. The driver of the vehicle complied with the traffic stop, pulling into a parking lot. As the vehicle came to a stop, the male driver attempted to exit the vehicle. Officers instructed the subject to remain in the vehicle and he complied. On initial contact with the occupants of the vehicle (a male driver and female passenger), officers determined the driver was not the registered owner the of vehicle and was not carrying identification but provided a name and date of birth. The officers returned to their vehicle to conduct a records check and determined the information provided by the driver was false. The officers requested additional units and two additional two-officer units arrived, as backup. Shortly after backup arrived, the driver fled the vehicle on foot, clutching the front of his sweatshirt with his right hand in a manner which lead officers to believe he was in possession of a weapon. All six officers pursued the subject across several lanes of traffic and into the 900 block of North 96th Street, where an officer used a takedown to bringing the subject to the ground. During the takedown a firearm fell from the subject, onto the ground. Officers continued to struggle to bring the subject into the prone position and control his hands. Officers issued commands for the subject to “stop reaching for the gun” and a closed fisted strike to the back. One officer attempted a brace contact shot from their firearm, against the subject’s forearm but the firearm was out of battery (a condition in which the firearm will not discharge). Another officer placed his firearm against the subject’s head and attempted, several times, a brace contact shot. The firearm was again, out of battery and did not discharge. The officer cleared the out of battery condition, placed the firearm against the subject’s head and fired one round, behind the left ear. Officers took the subject into custody and rendered aid. The Seattle Fire Department arrived at 5:09 P.M. and took over care. The subject was pronounced dead at 5:11 P.M.

The caller reported hearing a female screaming for help in Spanish, asking for someone to “call the police.” At 3:28 A.M., the first of three Seattle Police Officers arrived at the location, an apartment building and began investigating. A witness directed them to a unit in the apartment complex, where the officers attempted contact but received no reply. The officers began to clear the area and were in the parking lot when the Communication Center received a 911 call from inside the unit the officers just attempted to contact. The female caller said repeatedly, “He killed her.” At 3:41 A.M., officers, dressed in full uniform and announcing themselves as Seattle Police made forced entry with their weapons drawn and began clearing the apartment. Through their search of the unit, officers identified a door which was significantly damaged and appeared as though someone had kicked, punched, or cut through it. Officers announced themselves and forced entry into the room. The door opened only partially, as it was blocked by a body of an adult female, decapitated, laying on the floor, in a significant quantity of blood. Officers observed a male subject in the room, just past the body, holding a large kitchen knife and a meat cleaver. Officers ordered the subject to drop the weapons and get down on the floor. The subject complied initially, responding in a mix of English and Spanish, “show my your placa [badge]”. The subject became agitated, stood up and began searching the room. Officer ordered the subject to stop in Spanish (“Alto!”) and identified themselves as “Policia!” The subject eventually located the weapons and began to advance on the officers. When the subject was approximately five or six feet from the officers, two of the officers fired on the subject five times. The subject was hit multiple times and fell. The subject attempted to stand up again, with the knife in his hand. One officer fired a single additional round, causing the subject to fall once more, throwing the knife.  Officers secured the subject and began to render aid. Seattle Fire Department paramedics responded and took over care. The subject died at the scene. The second female subject who called 911 was located, barricaded in an adjacent room.
20190000098802	POLICE OFFICER	White	Male	3	Handgun	Male	Asian	37	No	Yes	Within Policy	No	On the 19th of March 2019, at 9:21 P.M., Settle Police Officers were dispatched to a call from the 1600 block of Melrose Ave. The caller reported her husband was suicidal, was in a possession of a handgun, was leaving their apartment and may intend “suicide by cop.” Twelve officers responded to the area and began to form two contact teams, one to the west and one to the south of the reported location. A rifle equipped officer and a ballistic shield were requested and responded to the area. An officer with a less lethal, 40 mm multiple rubber baton projectile was also on scene. As the teams was forming up and preparing to enter the area, the officer with the shield dropped it, causing a loud noise some mistook for a gunshot. The officer advised those within earshot that he dropped the shield but did not broadcast that information over the radio. At 9:28 P.M., officers in the contact team to the west located the subject on the sidewalk, in front of the building where the call came from. Officers reported hearing the subject “rack” or cycle a weapon. Officers from the west contact team, dressed in full uniform, approached the subject and ordered the subject to surrender and put his hands in the air. Officers in the south contact team, repositioned across the street to prevent a crossfire situation, if the subject attempted to flee in their direction (to the south). The officer with the 40mm less lethal weapon, in the west contact team, observed the subject “extend out his arm, with a black object in his hand,” toward his team and fired on the subject, without providing an audible warning. Four officers, including the rifle officer, discharged between one and multiple rounds, striking the subject once. The subject fell to the ground and was taken into custody. Officers rendered aid. Seattle Fire Department paramedics arrived and continued care. The subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he recovered from his injuries. The subject was charged with 1st Degree Assault.
20190000160099	POLICE OFFICER	White	Male	6	Handgun	Male	Black or African American	118	No	Yes	Within Policy	No	On the 5th of May 2019, at approximately 2:05 A.M., officers were in the Pioneer Square area monitoring bar closings when they heard gunfire they believed to be coming from a parking garage in the 500 block of 2nd Avenue. As officers converged on the parking garage, one Seattle Police Officer observed a subject on an upper deck of the garage discharge a handgun in the direction of officers and pedestrians below. The officer fired two rounds at the subject, who ducked down, out of sight. When the subject returned to a standing position, the firearm was no-longer visible. Other officers established cover and continued the response. A short time later, officers stopped a vehicle attempting to exit the garage and detained three subjects. The driver admitted he was in possession of a handgun. A passenger of the vehicle had a gunshot wound to the lower leg. Officers investigating an assault, nearby, recovered private video showing a physical altercation between the occupants of the vehicle and other subjects. During this altercation, the driver was observed discharging a firearm, in the direction of the wounded subject. Bodyworn Video and statements made by the officer who fired on the subject, suggest the officer did not fire on the subject who was wounded. Additionally, the subject the officer fired upon was only visible from the waist up. The subjects’ legs were not visible or in the line of fire of the officer. The subject was charged with felony assault. Statements made by the subject to Homicide Detectives conducting follow-up, indicated the subject was unaware he had been fired on by police and was only made aware, after the fact. Through the force investigation it appears the man fired at an unidentified subject and was himself shot and wounded by another party. SPD officers saw the man fire his gun and fired at him, but forensic analysis, including the trajectory of officers’ rounds found in a nearby building and a walkway obscuring the man’s lower extremities from officers’ line of fire—indicates his wounds were not caused by officers’ gunfire.

The caller reported she had called earlier but was tackled by her boyfriend, who was attempting to kill her and then himself. The caller was barricaded in a room inside the residence and reported the boyfriend was still in the residence, armed with a knife. Three Seattle Police Officers responded and attempted contact through the door. The officers identified themselves and ordered the door to be opened. When no response was received, the officers forced entry. Upon entry, the subject was observed, just inside the residence, shirtless, with a knife.
